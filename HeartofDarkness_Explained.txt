. What were we who had strayed 
(move about aimlessly or without any destination, often in search of food or employment)

! Yet 
(up to the present time)

with it -- no more than if I had been told an angel

(a cruel wicked and inhuman person)
was in there . I believed

(change one's facial expression by spreading the lips, often to signal pleasure)

, he would -- though a man of sixty 
(the cardinal number that is the product of ten and six)

-- offer to fight you . I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz , but 
I went for him near enough to a lie . You know I hate , detest , and ca n't bear 
(have)

a lie , not because I am straighter 
(successive (without a break))
than the rest 
of us , but simply because it appalls 
(strike with disgust or revulsion)
me . There

(engage in)
me miserable 
(very unhappy; full of misery)
and sick ,

near enough to it by letting

the young fool 
(a person who lacks good judgment)
there believe anything he liked 
(prefer or wish to do something)

to imagine as to my influence

(occurring with no delay)
as much of a pretence 
(a false or unsupportable quality)

as the rest of the bewitched 
(under a spell)

(someone who journeys in foreign lands)

. This simply because I had a notion 
(a vague idea in which some confidence is placed)

it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see -- you 
understand . He was just a word for me . I did not see the man in the name any more

a spot , roughly 
((of quantities) imprecise but fairly close to correct)
speaking 
(express in speech)

, about a mile and a half below Kurtz 's station 
(a facility equipped with special equipment and personnel for a particular purpose)

. We had just floundered 
(walk with great difficulty)
and flopped 
(fall loosely)

round a bend 
(a circular segment of a curve)
, when I saw an islet 
(a small island)

, a mere 
(being nothing more than specified)
grassy hummock 
(a small natural hill)

of bright green , in the middle of the stream 
(a natural body of running water flowing on or under the earth)

. It was the only thing of the kind ; but as we opened 
(cause to open or to become open)

the reach more , I perceived 
(to become aware of through the senses)
it was the 
head of a long sand-bank , or rather of a chain 
(a series of things depending on each other as if linked together)

of shallow 
(lacking physical depth; having little spatial extension downward or inward from an outer surface or backward or outward from a center)

patches 
(a small contrasting part of something)
stretching 
(occupy a large, elongated area)

down the middle of the river 
(a large natural stream of water (larger than a creek))

. They were discoloured 
(change color, often in an undesired manner)
, just awash 
(covered with water)

, and the whole lot was seen just under the water , exactly as a man 's backbone 
(a central cohesive source of support and stability)

is seen running 
(move fast by using one's feet, with one foot off the ground at any given time)

down the middle of his back under the skin . Now 
(in the historical present; at this point in the narration of a series of past events)

, as far as I did see , I could go to the right or to the left of this . I did n't 
know either channel 
(a path over which electrical signals can pass)
, of course 
. The banks 
(English botanist who accompanied Captain Cook on his first voyage to the Pacific Ocean (1743-1820))

looked 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
pretty well alike 
(equally)

, the depth 
(the extent downward or backward or inward)
appeared 
(give a certain impression or have a certain outward aspect)

the same ; but as I had been informed 
(impart knowledge of some fact, state or affairs, or event to)

the station 
(a facility equipped with special equipment and personnel for a particular purpose)

was on the west 
(the countries of (originally) Europe and (now including) North America and South America)

side , I naturally 
(as might be expected)
headed 
(to go or travel towards)

the western

passage 
(the act of passing from one state or place to the next)
. `` No sooner 
(a native or resident of Oklahoma)

had we fairly 
(to a moderately sufficient extent or degree)
entered 
(to come or go into)

it than I became aware 
((sometimes followed by `of') having or showing knowledge or understanding or realization or perception)

it was much narrower 
(not wide)
than I had supposed 
(express a supposition)
. 
To the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal 
(a sandbank in a stretch of water that is visible at low tide)

, and to the right a high , steep 
(having a sharp inclination)
bank 
(sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water))

heavily 
(to a considerable degree)
overgrown 
(grow too large)
with bushes 
(a low woody perennial plant usually having several major stems)

. Above the bush 
(a low woody perennial plant usually having several major stems)

the trees 
(a tall perennial woody plant having a main trunk and branches forming a distinct elevated crown; includes both gymnosperms and angiosperms)

a broad 
(having great (or a certain) extent from one side to the other)
strip 
(a relatively long narrow piece of something)

of shadow had already fallen 
(descend in free fall under the influence of gravity)

on the water . In this shadow we steamed 
(travel by means of steam power)
up -- 
very slowly , as you may imagine . I sheered 
(turn sharply; change direction abruptly)

her well inshore 
(toward the shore)
-- the water being 
(have the quality of being; (copula, used with an adjective or a predicate noun))

(impart knowledge of some fact, state or affairs, or event to)

me . `` One of my hungry and forbearing

friends 
(a person you know well and regard with affection and trust)

was sounding 
(appear in a certain way)
in the bows 
(a knot with two loops and loose ends; used to tie shoelaces)

just below me . This steamboat 
(a boat propelled by a steam engine)
was exactly 
like a decked scow 
(any of various flat-bottomed boats with sloping ends)
. On 
the deck

(sealed vessel where water is converted to steam)
was 
in the fore-end , and the machinery 
(machines or machine systems collectively)

(a protective covering that covers or forms the top of a building)

, supported 
(give moral or psychological support, aid, or courage to)
on stanchions 
(any vertical post or rod used as a support)

. The funnel

a small cabin

built 
(make by combining materials and parts)

of light planks 
(a stout length of sawn timber; made in a wide variety of sizes and used for many purposes)

(include or contain; have as a component)

a couch , two camp-stools , a loaded

and a broad 
(having great (or a certain) extent from one side to the other)
shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

at each side . All these were always thrown 
(propel through the air)
open , of 
course . I spent my days 
(the time during which someone's life continues)
perched 
(sit, as on a branch)

up there on the extreme 
(the furthest or highest degree of something)

(wear or display in an ostentatious or proud manner)

a pair of brass 
(an alloy of copper and zinc)
earrings 
(jewelry to ornament the ear; usually clipped to the earlobe or fastened through a hole in the lobe)

(a loose dressing gown for women)
from the waist 
(the narrowing of the body between the ribs and hips)

to the ankles 
(a gliding joint between the distal ends of the tibia and fibula and the proximal end of the talus)

, and thought all the world of himself . He was the most unstable 
(lacking stability or fixity or firmness)

kind of fool 
(a person who lacks good judgment)
I had ever seen . He steered 
(direct the course; determine the direction of travelling)

with no end of a swagger

of an abject funk 
(a state of nervous depression)
, and would let that cripple 
of a steamboat get the upper 
(the higher of two berths)
hand of him in a minute 
. `` I was looking

down at 
the sounding-pole , and feeling 
(undergo an emotional sensation or be in a particular state of mind)

much annoyed 
(cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations)
to 
see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river 
(a large natural stream of water (larger than a creek))

, when I saw my poleman give up on the business suddenly , and stretch 
(a large and unbroken expanse or distance)

himself flat 
(having a surface without slope, tilt in which no part is higher or lower than another)

on the deck 
(any of various platforms built into a vessel)
, without even taking

(draw slowly or heavily)
his pole 
(a long (usually round) rod of wood or metal or plastic)

in . He kept hold on it though , and it trailed 
(to lag or linger behind)
in the 
water . At the same time the fireman 
(play in which children pretend to put out a fire)

, whom I could also see below me , sat down abruptly 
(quickly and without warning)

before his furnace 
(an enclosed chamber in which heat is produced to heat buildings, destroy refuse, smelt or refine ores, etc.)

and ducked 
(to move (the head or body) quickly downwards or away)
his head . I 
was amazed 
(affect with wonder)
. Then 
(subsequently or soon afterward (often used as sentence connectors))

I had to look at the river 
(a large natural stream of water (larger than a creek))

mighty quick , because there was a snag 
(a sharp protuberance)
in the fairway 
(the area between the tee and putting green where the grass is cut short)

. Sticks 
(an implement consisting of a length of wood)
, little sticks 
(an implement consisting of a length of wood)

, were flying

about -- thick : they were 
whizzing 
(make a soft swishing sound)
before my nose , dropping 
(let fall to the ground)

below me , striking 
(deliver a sharp blow, as with the hand, fist, or weapon)
behind 
me against my pilot-house . All this time the river 
(a large natural stream of water (larger than a creek))

, the shore 
(the land along the edge of a body of water)
, the woods 
(the trees and other plants in a large densely wooded area)

, were very quiet -- perfectly 
(completely and without qualification; used informally as intensifiers)

quiet . I could only hear the heavy splashing 
(the act of splashing a (liquid) substance on a surface)

thump 
(a heavy dull sound (as made by impact of heavy objects))
of the stern-wheel 
and the patter 
(plausible glib talk (especially useful to a salesperson))
of these 
things 
(any movable possession (especially articles of clothing))
. We cleared 
(rid of obstructions)

the snag 
(a sharp protuberance)
clumsily 
(in a clumsy manner)
. Arrows , by Jove 
! We were being 
(have the quality of being; (copula, used with an adjective or a predicate noun))

shot at ! I stepped 
(shift or move by taking a step)
in quickly to close the shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

on the landside 
(component consisting of a side piece opposite the moldboard)
. 
That fool-helmsman , his hands 
((with `in') guardianship over; in divorce cases it is the right to house and care for and discipline a child)

on the spokes 
(support consisting of a radial member of a wheel joining the hub to the rim)

, was lifting 
(raise from a lower to a higher position)
his knees 
(hinge joint in the human leg connecting the tibia and fibula with the femur and protected in front by the patella)

high , stamping 
(walk heavily)
his feet , champing 
(chafe at the bit, like horses)

his mouth , like a reined-in horse . Confound him ! And we were staggering 
(walk as if unable to control one's movements)

within ten feet of the bank 
(sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water))

. I had to lean right out to swing 
(a state of steady vigorous action that is characteristic of an activity)

the heavy shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

, and I saw a face amongst the leaves 
(the main organ of photosynthesis and transpiration in higher plants)

on the level 
(a position on a scale of intensity or amount or quality)
with my 
own , looking 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
at me very fierce 
(marked by extreme and violent energy)

and steady 
(not subject to change or variation especially in behavior)
; and then 
suddenly , as though a veil 
(a garment that covers the head and face)
had been 
removed 
(remove something concrete, as by lifting, pushing, or taking off, or remove something abstract)

from my eyes 
(opinion or judgment)
, I made out , deep in the tangled

(a state of partial or total darkness)
, naked breasts 
(the front of the trunk from the neck to the abdomen)

, arms

(a low woody perennial plant usually having several major stems)

was swarming 
(be teeming, be abuzz)
with human limbs 
(one of the jointed appendages of an animal used for locomotion or grasping: arm; leg; wing; flipper)

in movement 
(a change of position that does not entail a change of location)
, 
glistening 
(be shiny, as if wet)
of bronze 
(an alloy of copper and tin and sometimes other elements; also any copper-base alloy containing other elements in place of tin)

colour . The twigs 
(a small branch or division of a branch (especially a terminal division); usually applied to branches of the current or preceding year)

shook , swayed 
(move back and forth or sideways)
, and rustled 
(make a dry crackling sound)

, the arrows 
(a mark to indicate a direction or relation)
flew 
(travel through the air; be airborne)

out of them , and then the shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

came to . 'Steer her straight , ' I said to the helmsman 
(the person who steers a ship)

. He held his head rigid , face forward ; but his eyes 
(opinion or judgment)
rolled 
(move by turning over or rotating)

, he kept on lifting and setting 
(put into a certain place or abstract location)

down his feet gently , his mouth foamed 
(become bubbly or frothy or foaming)
a 
little . 'Keep quiet ! ' I said in a fury 
(a feeling of intense anger)
. I might 
just as well have ordered 
(give instructions to or direct somebody to do something with authority)

a tree not to sway 
(move back and forth or sideways)
in the wind . I darted 
(move along rapidly and lightly; skim or dart)

out . Below me there was a great scuffle 
(disorderly fighting)
of feet on the iron 
(a heavy ductile magnetic metallic element; is silver-white in pure form but readily rusts; used in construction and tools and armament; plays a role in the transport of oxygen by the blood)

deck 
(any of various platforms built into a vessel)
; confused 
(mistake one thing for another)

exclamations 
(an abrupt excited utterance)
; a voice screamed 
(utter a sudden loud cry)

, 'Can you turn back ? ' I caught sight of a V-shaped 
(shaped in the form of the letter V)

ripple 
(a small wave on the surface of a liquid)
on the water ahead . What ? Another 
snag 
(a sharp protuberance)
! A fusillade 
(rapid simultaneous discharge of firearms)

burst out under my feet . The pilgrims 
(someone who journeys in foreign lands)

had opened 
(cause to open or to become open)
with their Winchesters 
(a city in southern England; administrative center of Hampshire)

, and were simply squirting 
(cause to come out in a squirt)
lead into that bush 
(not of the highest quality or sophistication)

. A deuce 
(a tie in tennis or table tennis that requires winning two successive points to win the game)

of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward . I swore 
(utter obscenities or profanities)

at it . Now 
(in the historical present; at this point in the narration of a series of past events)

I could n't see the ripple 
(a small wave on the surface of a liquid)
or the snag 
(a sharp protuberance)

either . I stood in the doorway 
(the entrance (the space in a wall) through which you enter or leave a room or building; the space that a door can close)

, peering 
(look searchingly)
, and the arrows 
(a mark to indicate a direction or relation)

came in swarms 
(a moving crowd)
. They might have been poisoned 
(spoil as if by poison)

, but they looked 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
as though 
they would n't kill a cat . The bush 
(a low woody perennial plant usually having several major stems)

began to howl 
(a long loud emotional utterance)
. Our wood-cutters raised 
(raise the level or amount of something)

a warlike whoop 
(a loud hooting cry of exultation or excitement)
; the report 
(a written document describing the findings of some individual or group)

of a rifle 
(a shoulder firearm with a long barrel and a rifled bore)
just at my 
back deafened 
(be unbearably loud)
me . I glanced 
(throw a glance at; take a brief look at)

over my shoulder , and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made 
a dash 
(distinctive and stylish elegance)
at the wheel 
(a simple machine consisting of a circular frame with spokes (or a solid disc) that can rotate on a shaft or axle (as in vehicles or other machines))

. The fool-nigger had dropped 
(let fall to the ground)
everything , to throw the 
shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

open and let off that Martini-Henry . He stood before the wide opening 
(an open or empty space in or between things)

, glaring 
(look at with a fixed gaze)
, and I yelled 
(utter a sudden loud cry)

at him to come back , while I straightened 
(straighten up or out; make straight)

the sudden twist 
(an unforeseen development)
out of that steamboat . There was 
no room to turn even if I had wanted 
(feel or have a desire for; want strongly)

to , the snag 
(a sharp protuberance)
was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded 
(be confusing or perplexing to; cause to be unable to think clearly)

smoke , there was no time to lose , so I just crowded 
(cause to herd, drive, or crowd together)

her into the bank 
(sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water))

-- right into the bank 
(sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water))

, where I knew the water was deep . `` We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes 
(provide with a bushing)

in a whirl 
(confused movement)
of broken twigs 
(a small branch or division of a branch (especially a terminal division); usually applied to branches of the current or preceding year)

and flying 
(travel through the air; be airborne)
leaves 
(the main organ of photosynthesis and transpiration in higher plants)

. The fusillade 
(rapid simultaneous discharge of firearms)
below stopped 
(come to a halt, stop moving)

short , as I had foreseen 
(realize beforehand)
it would when the squirts 
(someone who is small and insignificant)

got empty . I threw my head back to a glinting whizz 
(someone who is dazzlingly skilled in any field)

that traversed 
(travel across or pass over)
the pilot-house , in at one shutter-hole 
and out at the other . Looking past that mad helmsman 
(the person who steers a ship)

, who was shaking 
(move or cause to move back and forth)
the empty rifle 
(a shoulder firearm with a long barrel and a rifled bore)

and yelling 
(utter a sudden loud cry)
at the shore 
(the land along the edge of a body of water)

, I saw vague 
(not clearly understood or expressed)
forms 
(the phonological or orthographic sound or appearance of a word that can be used to describe or identify something)

of men running 
(move fast by using one's feet, with one foot off the ground at any given time)

bent 
(a relatively permanent inclination to react in a particular way)
double 
(having more than one decidedly dissimilar aspects or qualities; public preaching and private influence"- R.W.Emerson)

, leaping 
(move forward by leaps and bounds)
, gliding 
(move smoothly and effortlessly)

, distinct 
((often followed by `from') not alike; different in nature or quality)

, incomplete 
(not complete or total; not completed)
, evanescent . Something big 
appeared 
(give a certain impression or have a certain outward aspect)
in the air 
before the shutter 
(a mechanical device on a camera that opens and closes to control the time of a photographic exposure)

, the rifle 
(a shoulder firearm with a long barrel and a rifled bore)
went overboard 
, and the man stepped 
(shift or move by taking a step)
back swiftly 
(in a swift manner)

, looked 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
at me over his shoulder 
in an extraordinary 
(beyond what is ordinary or usual; highly unusual or exceptional or remarkable)

, profound , familiar 
(well known or easily recognized)
manner 
(how something is done or how it happens)

, and fell upon my feet . The side of his head hit the wheel 
(a simple machine consisting of a circular frame with spokes (or a solid disc) that can rotate on a shaft or axle (as in vehicles or other machines))

twice , and the end of what appeared 
(give a certain impression or have a certain outward aspect)

a long cane 
(a stick that people can lean on to help them walk)
clattered 
(make a rattling sound)

round and knocked 
(deliver a sharp blow or push :"He knocked the glass clear across the room")

over a little camp-stool . It looked 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)

as though after wrenching 
(twist or pull violently or suddenly, especially so as to remove (something) from that to which it is attached or from where it originates)

that thing from somebody 
(a human being)
ashore he had lost his balance 
(a state of equilibrium)

in the effort 
(earnest and conscientious activity intended to do or accomplish something)

. The thin smoke had blown 
(exhale hard)
away , we were clear of the snag 
(a sharp protuberance)

, and looking 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
ahead I could 
see that in another hundred yards 
(a unit of length equal to 3 feet; defined as 91.44 centimeters; originally taken to be the average length of a stride)

or so I would be free to sheer off , away from the bank 
(sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water))

; but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down . The man had rolled 
(move by turning over or rotating)

on his back and stared 
(look at with fixed eyes)
straight up at me ; both his hands 
((with `in') guardianship over; in divorce cases it is the right to house and care for and discipline a child)

clutched 
(take hold of; grab)
that cane 
(a stick that people can lean on to help them walk)

. It was the shaft 
(a line that forms the length of an arrow pointer)
of a spear 
that , either thrown or lunged 
(make a thrusting forward movement)
through the 
opening 
(cause to open or to become open)
, had caught him in the side , just below 
the ribs 
(support resembling the rib of an animal)
; the blade 
(especially a leaf of grass or the broad portion of a leaf as distinct from the petiole)

had gone in out of sight , after making 
(engage in)
a frightful 
(provoking horror)

gash 
(a wound made by cutting)
; my shoes 
(furnish with shoes)
were full ; a pool 
(an excavation that is (usually) filled with water)

of blood lay very still , gleaming 
(be shiny, as if wet)
dark-red under the wheel 
(a simple machine consisting of a circular frame with spokes (or a solid disc) that can rotate on a shaft or axle (as in vehicles or other machines))

; his eyes 
(opinion or judgment)
shone with an amazing 
(affect with wonder)
lustre 
(a surface coating for ceramics or porcelain)

. The fusillade 
(rapid simultaneous discharge of firearms)
burst out again . He 
looked 
(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)
at me anxiously 
(with anxiety or apprehension)

, gripping 
(hold fast or firmly)
the spear 
(a long pointed rod used as a tool or weapon)

like something precious 
(characterized by feeling or showing fond affection for)

, with an air of being 
(have the quality of being; (copula, used with an adjective or a predicate noun))

afraid I would try to take it away from him . I had to make an effort 
(earnest and conscientious activity intended to do or accomplish something)

to free my eyes 
(opinion or judgment)
from his gaze and attend to the steering 
(the act of guiding or showing the way)

. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the steam 
(water at boiling temperature diffused in the atmosphere)

whistle 
(the sound made by something moving rapidly or by steam coming out of a small aperture)

, and jerked 
(pull, or move with a sudden movement)
out screech after screech 
(a high-pitched noise resembling a human cry)

hurriedly 
(in a hurried or hasty manner)
. The tumult 
(a state of commotion and noise and confusion)

of angry and warlike yells 
(a loud utterance; often in protest or opposition)
was 
checked 
(examine so as to determine accuracy, quality, or condition)
instantly 
(without delay or hesitation; with no time intervening)

, and then from the depths 
(the extent downward or backward or inward)
of the woods 
(the trees and other plants in a large densely wooded area)

went out such a tremulous 
((of the voice) quivering as from weakness or fear)
and 
prolonged 
(lengthen in time; cause to be or last longer)
wail 
(a cry of sorrow and grief)

of mournful 
(expressing sorrow)
fear and utter despair 
(a state in which all hope is lost or absent)

as may be imagined 
(form a mental image of something that is not present or that is not the case)

to follow the flight 
(a formation of aircraft in flight)
of the last hope from 
the earth . There was a great commotion 
(a disorderly outburst or tumult)
in the 
bush 
(a low woody perennial plant usually having several major stems)
; the shower 
of arrows 
(a mark to indicate a direction or relation)
stopped 
(come to a halt, stop moving)

, a few dropping shots 
(the act of firing a projectile)
rang out sharply

was magnificent

(the time yet to come)
a good influence

in a black Sahara . Well , do n't you see , he had done something , he had steered

; for months

I had him at my 
back -- a help -- an instrument

. 
It was a kind of partnership 
(the members of a business venture created by contract)

. He steered 
(direct the course; determine the direction of travelling)
for me

to my breast 
(the front of the trunk from the neck to the abdomen)

; I hugged 
(squeeze (someone) tightly in your arms, usually with fondness)
him 
from behind desperately 
(with great urgency)
. Oh ! he was heavy , heavy ; heavier 
than any man on earth , I should imagine . Then 
(subsequently or soon afterward (often used as sentence connectors))

without more ado I tipped 
(cause to tilt)
him overboard 
(to extremes)
. The current 
(occurring in or belonging to the present time)

snatched him as though he had been a wisp 
(a small tuft or lock)
of grass 
(narrow-leaved green herbage: grown as lawns; used as pasture for grazing animals; cut and dried as hay)

(someone who controls resources and expenditures)

were then congregated

on the deck

, and with a better show of reason -- though I admit that the reason itself was

(the person who steers a ship)
was to be eaten

(a facility equipped with special equipment and personnel for a particular purpose)

had been burnt 
(destroy by fire)
-- and so on -- and so on . The red-haired pilgrim

and then cleared 
(rid of obstructions)

I had to be careful , of course , till we got friendly again for a time . He had

(despite anything to the contrary (usually following a concession))

he had got much worse suddenly . 'I heard he was lying

(in the historical present; at this point in the narration of a series of past events)

I had suddenly a nearer view 
(a way of regarding situations or topics etc.)
, and 
its first result 
(a phenomenon that follows and is caused by some previous phenomenon)

was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow 
(a powerful stroke with the fist or a weapon)

. Then 
(subsequently or soon afterward (often used as sentence connectors))
I went 
carefully from post 
(the position where someone (as a guard or sentry) stands or is assigned to stand)

to post 
(affix in a public place or for public notice)
with my glass , and I saw 
my mistake

. These round knobs 
(a circular rounded projection or protuberance)

(change orientation or direction, also in the abstract sense)

to the house . Only 
(and nothing more)
one , the first I had made out , was facing 
(deal with (something unpleasant) head on)

my way . I was not so shocked 
(surprise greatly; knock someone's socks off)
as 
you may think . The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement 
(a change of position that does not entail a change of location)

(regard something as probable or likely)
to see a 
knob

(destroy completely; damage irreparably)

(feel or have a desire for; want strongly)

in him -- some small matter which , when the pressing 
(the act of pressing; the exertion of pressure)

need arose , could not be found under his magnificent eloquence 
(powerful and effective language)

. Whether he knew of this deficiency 
(the state of needing something that is absent or unavailable)

himself I ca n't say . I think the knowledge 
(the psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning)

had found him out early , and had taken on him a terrible

of which he had no conception

till he took counsel

-- and the whisper had proved

irresistibly

fascinating 
(cause to be interested or curious)
. It echoed 
(to say again or imitate)

loudly 
(with relatively high volume)
within him because he was hollow at the core

... . I put down the glass , and the head that had appeared

at once to have leaped

. `` 
The admirer 
(a person who backs a politician or a team etc.)

(make certain of)
me he had not dared 
(take upon oneself; act presumptuously, without permission)

to take these -- say , symbols 
(an arbitrary sign (written or printed) that has acquired a conventional significance)

-- down . He was not afraid of the natives 
(an indigenous person who was born in a particular place)

; they would not stir 
(move an implement through)
till Mr. Kurtz gave the word 
. His ascendancy 
(the state that exists when one person or group has power over another)

was extraordinary 
(beyond what is ordinary or usual; highly unusual or exceptional or remarkable)

. The camps

. Curious

that came over me that such details

(perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards)

at me with surprise . I suppose it did not occur 
(come to pass)
to him that Mr. 
Kurtz was no idol 
(a material effigy that is worshipped)
of mine . He forgot 
(dismiss from the mind; stop remembering)

I had n't heard any of these splendid

monologues 
(speech you make to yourself)

on , what was it ? on love , justice 
(the quality of being just or fair)
, conduct 
(manner of acting or controlling yourself)

of life -- or what not . If it had come to crawling 
(a slow mode of locomotion on hands and knees or dragging the body)

before Mr. Kurtz , he crawled 
(move slowly; in the case of people or animals with the body near the ground)

as much as the veriest savage 
(a member of an uncivilized people)
of them all . 
I had no idea of the conditions 
(the prevailing context that influences the performance or the outcome of a process)

of rebels 
(`Johnny' was applied as a nickname for Confederate soldiers by the Federal soldiers in the American Civil War; `greyback' derived from their grey Confederate uniforms)

him excessively

by laughing . Rebels

, workers 
(a person who works at a specific occupation)

looked

know how such a life tries

me to ... ? ' His feelings 
(emotional or moral sensitivity (especially in relation to personal principles or dignity))

were too much for speech 
(the act of delivering a formal spoken communication to an audience)

, and suddenly he broke down . 'I do n't understand , ' he groaned 
(indicate pain, discomfort, or displeasure)

in its right proportion

. It was by no means

, and said in a tone of scathing contempt

(someone who journeys in foreign lands)

rushed

. However 
(despite anything to the contrary (usually following a concession))

, I did not eat much . There was a lamp

in there -- light , do n't you know -- and outside it was so beastly

upon the adventures 
(a wild and exciting undertaking (not necessarily lawful))

of his soul 
(the immaterial part of a person; the actuating cause of an individual life)

. The voice 
was gone . What else had been there ? But I am of course aware that next day the 
pilgrims 
(someone who journeys in foreign lands)
buried 
(cover from sight)
something 
in a muddy hole . `` And then they very nearly buried 
(cover from sight)
me . `` 
However 
(despite anything to the contrary (usually following a concession))
, as 
you see , I did not go to join Kurtz there and then . I did not . I remained 
(stay the same; remain in a certain state)

to dream the nightmare

out to the end 
, and to show my loyalty 
(the quality of being loyal)
to Kurtz once more . Destiny

regrets 
(a polite refusal of an invitation)
. I have wrestled 
(combat to overcome an opposing tendency or force)

with death . It is the most unexciting contest 
(an occasion on which a winner is selected from among two or more contestants)

you can imagine . It takes 
(carry out)
place in an impalpable

greyness 
(a neutral achromatic color midway between white and black)
, with nothing 
underfoot , with nothing around , without spectators

, without clamour , without glory

, without the great fear 
of defeat 
(an unsuccessful ending to a struggle or contest)
, in a sickly atmosphere 
of tepid 
(moderately warm)
scepticism 
(the disbelief in any claims of ultimate knowledge)

, without much belief 
(any cognitive content held as true)
in your own right , 
and still less in that of your adversary . If such is the form of ultimate 
(furthest or highest in degree or order; utmost or extreme)

wisdom 
(accumulated knowledge or erudition or enlightenment)
, then life is a greater 
(greater in size or importance or degree)

riddle 
(a difficult problem)
than some of us think it to be . I was within a hair 
's breadth 
(the capacity to understand a broad range of topics)
of the last opportunity 
(a possibility due to a favorable combination of circumstances)

for pronouncement 
(an authoritative declaration)
, and I found with humiliation 
(state of disgrace or loss of self-respect)

that probably I would have nothing to say . This is the reason why I affirm 
(establish or strengthen as with new evidence or facts)

that Kurtz was a remarkable 
(unusual or striking)
man . He had something to say 
. He said it . Since I had peeped 
(look furtively)
over the edge myself , I understand 
better the meaning 
(the message that is intended or expressed or signified)
of 
his stare , that could not see the flame 
(the process of combustion of inflammable materials producing heat and light and (often) smoke)

of the candle 
(stick of wax with a wick in the middle)
, but was wide enough to 
embrace 
(include in scope; include as part of something broader; have as one's sphere or territory)

the whole universe 
(everything that exists anywhere)
, piercing 
(cut or make a way through)

enough to penetrate 
(pass into or through, often by overcoming resistance)
all 
the hearts 
(a form of whist in which players avoid winning tricks containing hearts or the queen of spades)

that beat in the darkness 
(absence of light or illumination)
. He had summed 
(be a summary of)

up -- he had judged 
(determine the result of (a competition))
. 'The horror 
(intense and profound fear)

! ' He was a remarkable 
(unusual or striking)
man . After all , this was the expression 
of some sort of belief 
(any cognitive content held as true)
; it had candour , 
it had conviction 
(an unshakable belief in something without need for proof or evidence)

, it had a vibrating note of revolt 
(organized opposition to authority; a conflict in which one faction tries to wrest control from another)

in its whisper , it had the appalling 
(an experience that appalls)
face of a glimpsed 
(catch a glimpse of or see briefly)

truth -- the strange commingling 
(mix or blend)
of desire 
(the feeling that accompanies an unsatisfied state)

and hate . And it is not my own extremity 
(an external body part that projects from the body)

I remember best -- a vision 
(a vivid mental image)
of greyness 
(a neutral achromatic color midway between white and black)

without form filled 
(make full, also in a metaphorical sense)
with physical 
(involving the body as distinguished from the mind or spirit)

pain , and a careless contempt 
(lack of respect accompanied by a feeling of intense dislike)

for the evanescence 
(the event of fading and gradually vanishing from sight)
of 
all things 
(any movable possession (especially articles of clothing))
-- even of 
this pain itself . No ! It is his extremity 
(an external body part that projects from the body)

that I seem to have lived 
(inhabit or live in; be an inhabitant of)
through . True 
, he had made that last stride 
(a step in walking or running)
, he had stepped 
(shift or move by taking a step)

over the edge , while I had been permitted 
(consent to, give permission)
to draw 
back my hesitating foot . And perhaps in this is the whole difference 
(the quality of being unlike or dissimilar)

; perhaps all the wisdom 
(accumulated knowledge or erudition or enlightenment)

, and all truth , and all sincerity 
(an earnest and sincere feeling)
, are just 
compressed 
(make more compact by or as if by pressing)
into that inappreciable 
(too small to make a significant difference)

moment of time in which we step over the threshold 
(the starting point for a new state or experience)

of the invisible 
(impossible or nearly impossible to see; imperceptible by the eye)

. Perhaps 
(by chance)
! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a word 
of careless contempt 
(lack of respect accompanied by a feeling of intense dislike)

. Better his cry -- much better . It was an affirmation 
(a statement asserting the existence or the truth of something)

, a moral 
(concerned with principles of right and wrong or conforming to standards of behavior and character based on those principles)

victory 
(a successful ending of a struggle or contest)
paid 
(give money, usually in exchange for goods or services)

for by innumerable 
(too numerous to be counted)
defeats 
(an unsuccessful ending to a struggle or contest)

terrors 
(an overwhelming feeling of fear and anxiety)

, by abominable 
(unequivocally detestable)
satisfactions 
(the contentment one feels when one has fulfilled a desire, need, or expectation)

. But it was a victory 
(a successful ending of a struggle or contest)
! That is 
why I have remained 
(stay the same; remain in a certain state)
loyal 
(steadfast in allegiance or duty)

to Kurtz to the last , and even beyond , when a long time after I heard once more 
, not his own voice , but the echo 
(the repetition of a sound resulting from reflection of the sound waves)

of his magnificent eloquence 
(powerful and effective language)
thrown to me from 
a soul 
(the immaterial part of a person; the actuating cause of an individual life)

as translucently pure as a cliff 
(a steep high face of rock)
of crystal 
(a solid formed by the solidification of a chemical and having a highly regular atomic structure)

. `` No , they did not bury 
(cover from sight)
me , though there is a period 
(an amount of time)

of time which I remember mistily 
(in a misty manner)
, with a shuddering wonder 
, like a passage 
(the act of passing from one state or place to the next)
through 
some inconceivable 
(totally unlikely)
world that had no hope in it and no desire 
(the feeling that accompanies an unsatisfied state)

. I found myself back in the sepulchral

upon my thoughts 
(the content of cognition; the main thing you are thinking about)

. They were intruders 
(someone who intrudes on the privacy or property of another without permission)

whose knowledge 
(the psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning)

of life was to me an irritating 
(cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations)

pretence 
(a false or unsupportable quality)
, because I felt so sure they could 
not possibly 
(by chance)
know the things

them , but I had some difficulty

in restraining 
myself from laughing 
(produce laughter)
in their faces 
(the front of the human head from the forehead to the chin and ear to ear)

so full of stupid importance

. I daresay I was not very well at that time . I tottered 
(move without being stable, as if threatening to fall)

about the streets
